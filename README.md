# Early-Stage-Diabetes-Detection
Predicts risk for diabetes based on symptoms\
Implemented using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

# What I Learned
 * Utilizing Python Libraries such as sklearn and pandas
 * Preprocess data in order to make it clean and usable
 * Train and test a model using K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm
 * Utilizing Tkinter for a GUI to display the questions
